Summary

In this project, I focused on selecting specific property characteristics to refine the predictive model and ensure that the data used for 
predictions is both relevant and clean. 
Additionally, I incorporated a code snippet to remove rows containing more than 20% empty or null data, which helped in data preparation. 
Below is a breakdown of why these particular filters are useful:

1. Lot Area Between the 20th and 80th Percentiles

   Implementation: 
    
    Set the lower limit as `filtered_data['Lot Area'].quantile(0.20)` and the upper limit as 
   `filtered_data['Lot Area'].quantile(0.80)`.
   
   Why It's Useful:
     - The Lot Area is a key determinant of housing prices, representing the size of the property's land.
     - Using the 20th and 80th percentiles helps remove outliers—both extremely small and large properties—without discarding too much data.
     - Excluding extreme values ensures the model focuses on typical properties, enhancing its ability to generalize for future predictions.

2. Exclusion of Properties with Pools

   - Implementation: Filtered properties where `filtered_data['Pool Area'] < 1`.
   
   - Why It's Useful:
     - The presence of a pool significantly affects a property's price due to the added luxury.
     - Filtering out properties with pools (Pool Area less than 1) removes outliers since most homes in the dataset don't have pools.
     - This ensures the model isn't disproportionately influenced by these outliers, improving its suitability for predicting prices 
     - of typical homes.

3. Selection of Single-Family Homes

   - Implementation: Filtered data where `filtered_data['Bldg Type'] == '1Fam'`.
   
   - Why It's Useful:
     - Single-family homes ('1Fam') have distinct market characteristics compared to other building types like townhomes or duplexes.
     - Focusing on single-family homes ensures the analysis is narrowed to properties with similar characteristics, leading to better 
     - model performance when predicting prices for similar homes.

       4. Limiting Full Bathrooms to Less Than 3

          - Implementation: Filtered properties where `filtered_data['Full Bath'] < 3`.
   
          - Why It's Useful:
            - The number of full bathrooms influences a property's price, with more bathrooms often indicating luxury properties.
            - Homes with more than 3 full bathrooms can skew the price distribution.
            - By focusing on homes with fewer than 3 bathrooms, the model targets more common properties, improving its ability to 
            - predict prices of average homes.

           Model Evaluation

           I evaluated four models based on the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):

           Linear Regression

          - MAE: \$18,849
          - RMSE: \$25,171
          - Evaluation: The linear regression model performed adequately but exhibited relatively higher MAE and RMSE compared to other models. 
          - This indicates susceptibility to errors, particularly on data points with larger deviations.

           Polynomial Regression

          - MAE: \$17,824
          - RMSE: \$24,164
          - Evaluation: Polynomial regression improved upon the linear model by reducing both MAE and RMSE. This suggests that the model captured 
          - some non-linear relationships between the features and the target variable, enhancing overall prediction quality.

           Gradient Boosting Regressor

          - MAE: \$17,101
          - RMSE: \$23,733
          - Evaluation: The Gradient Boosting Regressor delivered the best performance among all models, with the lowest MAE and RMSE. 
          - This indicates consistent and accurate predictions, with reduced influence from larger errors due to its capability to handle 
          - complex patterns and non-linearities effectively.

           Random Forest Regressor

          - MAE: \$17,804
          - RMSE: \$24,841
          - Evaluation: The Random Forest model performed well but was slightly outperformed by the Gradient Boosting Regressor. 
          - The slightly higher RMSE suggests it was less effective in handling the dataset's specific relationships.

           Conclusion and Recommendation

           Best Model: The Gradient Boosting Regressor is recommended as it outperforms the other models in both MAE and RMSE. Its ability to handle larger errors effectively (as indicated by the lower RMSE) and provide more accurate predictions on average (lower MAE) makes 
            it the optimal choice for this dataset.

Next Steps:

- Model Tuning: Further optimization through hyperparameter tuning (e.g., adjusting the learning rate or the number of estimators) 
could enhance performance.

- Feature Engineering: Additional feature exploration and engineering may uncover more predictive variables, improving model accuracy.

Summary of Model Evaluation Metrics

| Model                     | Mean Absolute Error (MAE) | Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) |
|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Linear Regression         | \$18,849                  | \$25,171                        |
| Polynomial Regression     | \$17,824                  | \$24,164                        |
| Gradient Boosting         | \$17,101                  | \$23,733                        |
| Random Forest Regressor   | \$17,804                  | \$24,841                        |

In conclusion, the Gradient Boosting Regressor provides the most accurate predictions for this dataset. If further refinement 
is needed, model tuning or additional feature engineering may enhance performance.
